1  good  folder  structure         //          for  exmaple  you  are building the app
                                               and then u realize that app  grows in  complexity  
                                               thats when  you need  to build new component  in the same file
                                               and then move it to  another file and export 
                                               2.  the  component  must go  standalone  when you  can  reuse it 
                                               3 .  how to  ordanize  folders  :
                                               the group  of files that have  similar  abstraction by their 
                                               functionalities 
                                               
  
  2  component  design           // 
                                              1   usually  you  add  a lot  of  complexity 
                                                   as  a  provider  or the context   or   routes 
                                                   to the App  component :  try  to  delegate  the  complexity so the app is  cleaner 
                                                   
                                              2   imports   : first  import  the third  party  apis and  lib
                                                     and then  create  little space and then  import the component
                                                     (external  imports  go  first )
                                            
   3 COMPONENT  PATTERNS               //     
                                               
                                                  when   you realixe  that the  logic  can be  used several  times 
                                                  you   should   put it into the custom hooks 
                                                  
                                                  use   les  usestate  as  possible 
                                                  instead  use  useReducer or maybe redux 
                                                  pascalCase name  stying   for the components
                                                  and the camelCase  styling for the  variables
